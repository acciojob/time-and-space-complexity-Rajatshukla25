	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a function that describes how long an algorithm takes in terms of the quantity of input it receives. Space complexity is a function that describes how much memory (space) an algorithm requires to the quantity of input to the method.</p>
	<p>O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size. O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space complexity grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor <b>Space Complexity</b></p>
